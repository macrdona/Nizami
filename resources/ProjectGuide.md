**Git and GitHub**

To download Git, go to this page https://git-scm.com/download/win

Once downloaded you can search on the windows search bar: "Git Bash" and it will open up a command line. Git Bash works with Linux commands, if you need some sort of reference I recommend looking at this sheet: https://www.guru99.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet.html

Git, which is a system for managing repositories, also has its own special commands. Here is a sheet with commonly used commands: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf. The commands you will care for the most part are: add, status, commit, clone, branch, and rm. I recommend watching a video on Git to learn how to use it appropriately. Here is one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc&t=1s

Here is the workflow for using Git: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git/modules/learn-git-git-teamwork-u. This is very important for avoiding errors, and this is something we will need to eventually learn when we start working in an industry setting. Let us do our best following this workflow. 

Now GitHub. It is essentially the same thing. GitHub is a user interface addition to Git which allows us to store our files on a remote repository. You may think of a repository as a folder containing all other files and folders. GitHub also allows us to collaborate, as we can share files with each other by uploading them to GitHub and then downloading them individually on each of our computers. 

**W3Schools**

Link to W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/

This website is pretty good for any looking at syntax from many popular programming languages. We will mainly be focusing on HTML, CSS, C#, and ASP.NET(or ASP)

**Microsoft Learn**

Link to Microsoft Learn: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/?source=learn

This page has many resources and tutorials on many topics, so it is pretty useful. Microsoft created .NET and C# so they will definitely have a lot of information on both. 

**web.dev**

Link: https://web.dev/

I believe this will aid us in the development of our project. This page contains some articles and examples on how to make our website better in terms of functionality and design. 

**Emmet**

Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet

Emmet can be used only in Visual Studio Code, which is basically a fancy text editor. I just recently learned about this extension and it is amazing. It allows you to write CSS and HTML code faster by typing shortcut commands. This is a game changer. 

**UseAnimations**

Seems dope for adding effects to our website icons. Just a cool addition.
